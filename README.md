# StakeBoard: Staking Dashboard for Staking Assets

Live version: [https://app.stakepark.xyz](https://app.stakepark.xyz)

Built by the [StakePark.xyz](https://www.stakepark.xyz) Team, StakeBoard is a staking dashboard app. Designed to help you keep tabs on active staking accounts in wallet. Supports many wallet connections, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and many more via WalletConnect.

With so many users burnt in 2022 by CeFi (Celsius, Voyager and so many others), we believe the time to learn how to stake natively is past due.\

Our creed is: Stake or die! :skull:
